# Abstract 
It has been argued that including the lagged dependent variable in panel models will open up unintended back-door paths and bias the estimates of the causal variable. We show that panel analysis in the structural equation modeling framework gets around this issue. Including the lagged dependent variable has the benefit of closing back-door paths due to unobserved time-varying confounders. We demonstrate this by looking at simulated data in the `lavaan` package for `R`.
